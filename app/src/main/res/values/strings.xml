    <string name="a_narrow">A narrow geographic market can be a successful market position for a small business. This is especially the case if there are opportunities to customize product or services to the specific needs of the local market. Larger businesses can find local knowledge difficult to obtain and the cost of adapting to the local market prohibitive.Targetting specific customers can be a successful strategyfor small businesses. It can allow them to adapt their products or services so they are better suited to the needs of their targetted customers. The internet has provided the opportunity for small scale firms to customise their products and services to very focused customer niches and then to service wide geographic areas. Large firms can find it hard to adapt their product and services to very focused customer segments.\n\n</string>
    <string name="offering">Offering few products or services can be successful strategy for small businesses Having a small range allows them to customize their products and services to particular customers and local markets. Larger firms are less likely to be so focused and may find it hard to compete.\n\n</string>
